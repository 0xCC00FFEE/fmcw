List of contents:

hardware: Contains KiCad schematic and board files. Made using KiCad version 2014-10-17 and might not open with a too old version.

firmware: Firmware for the Freescale Kinetis KL26Z microcontroller. Should be opened using Kinetis Design Studio (http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/prod_summary.jsp?code=KDS_IDE).

processing: PC code for using the radar and processing the resulting data.
"fmcw.py" uses the radar and logs the data.
"fmcw_process.py" process the recorded data and plots time-range plot of them.
"list_plot.py" plots individual sweep captures from the recorded data for debugging purposes.

simulations: CST Microwave studio files.
